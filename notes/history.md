## 2024-09-13 - Enhanced Development Environment

### Issues Resolved
- **Node.js Version Compatibility**: Fixed Sharp dependency issue by upgrading from Node.js v20.2.0 to v20.3.0
- **Development Setup**: Created comprehensive development environment with nvm for version management
- **Docker Optimization**: Updated Dockerfile with proper Node.js version, security improvements, and health checks

### Enhancements Added
1. **Package.json Improvements**:
   - Added proper metadata (name, description, author, license)
   - Specified Node.js engine requirements (>=20.3.0)
   - Added comprehensive npm scripts for development and deployment
   - Added keywords for better discoverability

2. **Development Tools**:
   - Created `setup-dev.sh` script for easy environment setup
   - Added `.nvmrc` file for consistent Node.js version across environments
   - Created comprehensive test suite (`test-server.js`)
   - Added example usage script (`example-usage.js`)

3. **Docker Improvements**:
   - Updated to use Node.js 20.3.0 specifically
   - Added non-root user for security
   - Implemented health checks
   - Optimized layer caching
   - Added proper error handling

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive README.md with usage examples
   - Added troubleshooting section
   - Documented all available scripts and commands

### Testing Results
- ✅ All server functionality working correctly
