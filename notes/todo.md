[ ] add endpoint to delete files in media folder
[ ] check and fix deprecation warning: [DEP0147] DeprecationWarning: In future versions of Node.js, fs.rmdir(path, { recursive: true }) will be removed. Use fs.rm(path, { recursive: true }) instead
[ ] fix Ken Burns calculations to take into account different a/r without breaking the videogeneration (again)
[ ] refactor code, move functions to seperate files for each endpoint (and a helper-file perhaps) to clean up server.js
